~~  Design Questions and Answers: ~~


1. What is the name of the app that you used for design inspiration?

CNN App. 


2. Which design element did you mimic?

We really liked how the CNN Feed has a clean, simple table view design. On the left side, there is a medium sized image relating to the news story and on the right side, there is a short description of the news story. 

However, we thought CNN's design was a bit plain so we rounded the corners of our pictures and added colored text and backgoround to make our app more fun and appealing to look at. 



3. Why was this design element appealing to you?

It was simple and to the point.
